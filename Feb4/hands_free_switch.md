**Here is the description of my hands free switch**

I have wished for this in my room: when I am going to bed I turn off the main light, close my door and end up in complete darkness on my way to the bed, which sometimes results in injury. 
I took this first project in Interactive Media as a way to challenge myself and fix my problem. I would get fairy lights and connect them to the closing mechanism of my door. When the wire on the mortise and the one on the tenon touch, that would close the circuit and the lights will turn on.
Here is the video documentation and the written description is under it:

Here is how I did this: 
I have a collection of fairy lights, so I took a look at the ones working with a battery and realized that they could be the LEDs I use for this project. So, I took them apart:

With a gentle push and a screwdriver, they were easy to piece apart.

Inside there is a chip with a resistor (labeled R) and a connection to the batteries, and the batteries. There is also a toggle that has three settings: off, light, and strong. The circuit looked very simple, just like the ones we discussed and made in class. From here on I knew what I had to do: add my interactive switch to the wire going to or from the battery. 
First I had to test if the doors transfer electricity as I would use them part of my switch. It worked:

Then I had to test if the wires I found in the recycling bin for wires were long enough, so I went back to my room and tested it out:

One of them needed a little cut, but otherwise, they fit well and did not go in my way too much. 
Now that I had the testing ready and successful I went back to the lab.
I cut the wire that returns to the battery: 

And then I soldered my two long wires to the ends of the two cuts. I secured them with a layer of plastic so that they don't touch as they are close to each other and there is a chance of that happening otherwise, and I don't want to short circuit them.
Shoutout to Jack who showed me the ropes and who also confirmed my ideas were correct along the way, which ensured I didn't destroy these lights along the way. 
 And then it worked! I went back to my room and I attached them to their places and now I have my little night light.

This is how it looks at the end.

There is a toggle on the lights, it has to be on in order for the door switch to work. Once I get inside my bed I can turn the toggle off and even though the switch is still on the lights go out and I can sleep. The next morning, I can turn the toggle on again and it will be ready for the night. 

Issues and Concerns: 
1) I don't keep my door closed any other time than when I am asleep so this device works. 
2) When the toggle is one there is electricity going in the circuit even though it is not closed, so there is a bit of waste of the batteries there. 
3)  I have secured one of the wires on the wall, and the other one, connected to the door is long enough to be moved around without falling. However, it still crosses my floor, so I have put a carpet on it. It should not be a problem. I can update if this is enough after I have used it for a while.
