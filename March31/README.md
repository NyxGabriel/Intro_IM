*Copy of a Famous Digital Painting*

For this week's assigment we had to create a copy of a famous digital painting and 
I chose [Untitled by Georg Ness](http://recodeproject.com/artwork/v1n2untitled18 "Untitled").
I selected it because I used to have a pair of earrings I really loved that looked exactly like one of the circles above. 

At first I wrote the code, with the random function. It was really sensitive about the number of lines,
so here  are two examples using different numbers of points. 
These were the results:
![Random 100 Lines, Untitiled](https://github.com/NyxGabriel/Intro_IM/blob/master/March31/random_small.png)

![Random 500 Lines, Untitiled](https://github.com/NyxGabriel/Intro_IM/blob/master/March31/random_big.png)
As you can see  when you increase the number of lines the circles start to look alike and not get filled as much. 

I wasn't happy so I decided to use the *noise* function and it created the desired effect, very similar to the original one:
![Noisy 300 lines, Untitiled](https://github.com/NyxGabriel/Intro_IM/blob/master/March31/noise_300.png)

![Noisy 500 lines, Untitiled](https://github.com/NyxGabriel/Intro_IM/blob/master/March31/noise_500.png)

I added some color in order to constibute to the painting myself. It can be found in the linesInCircle function and
it can be uncommented for similar effects.

Thank you very much!
