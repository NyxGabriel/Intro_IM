*Copy of a Famous Digital Painting*

For this week's assigment we had to create a copy of a famous digital painting and 
I chose [Untitled by Georg Ness](http://recodeproject.com/artwork/v1n2untitled18 "Untitled").
I selected it because I used to have a pair of earrings I really loved that looked exactly like one of the circles above. 

At first I wrote the code, with the random function. It was really sensitive about the number of lines,
so here  are two examples using different numbers of points. 
These were the results:
![Random 100 Lines, Untitiled]()

![Random 500 Lines, Untitiled]()
As you can see  when you increase the number of lines the circles start to look alike and not get filled as much. 

I wasn't happy so I decided to use the *noise* function and it created the desired effect, very similar to the original one:
![Noisy 300 lines, Untitiled]()

![Noisy 500 lines, Untitiled]()

I added some color in order to constibute to the painting myself. It can be found in the linesInCircle function and
it can be uncommented for similar effects.
![Noisy Colorful 400, Untitiled]()

Thank you very much!
