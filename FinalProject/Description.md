**First Draft of Final Project**

I want to use a library that trasnfers speech to text and then show this text in a spiral on the screen (in real time). 
In the center of the spiral there is going to be a word cloud that allows you to see the words you use the most (from current and previous sessions).
It is a type of a virtual diary that also serves to focus you on ideas you have and help you mediate. This is all contigent on my ability to use the speech to text library for [processing](https://github.com/getflourish/STT) I found. 
I hope it works out because it is a project I wish to have daily access to.
